# Brain Hypodensity Segmentation
Introduction -
This project focuses on developing a robust and efficient algorithm for the accurate segmentation of hypodense regions from Brain Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) images. The segmentation process is designed to be invariant to slice thickness and orientation, with the primary objective of automating and streamlining the identification of early ischemic changes in acute stroke patients.

Features -
Hypodensity Segmentation: The algorithm excels in accurately identifying and segmenting hypodense regions in brain NCCT images.

Slice Thickness and Orientation Invariance: The model's performance remains consistent regardless of variations in slice thickness and orientation.

Automation for Stroke Identification: The algorithm plays a crucial role in automating the identification of early ischemic changes, contributing to the efficient and timely diagnosis of acute stroke patients.
